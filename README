very early in development, only around 300 lines of
code.

I've tried to remain very modular:

- Profile
	-> Name
	-> ID
	-> Avatars
	-> Join Date
	-> Steam Rating
	-> 2 week time

- Games
	-> Hours Total
	-> Total Games
	-> Game List [Object]
		* Name
		* appID
		* Logo
		* Steam Store 
		* 2wk hours
		* Total hours

- Friends
 * coming soon

- Achievements
 * coming soon

- Cache
 * the caching system is pretty crude, it just requires a 
 writable directory named cache aka.

 mkdir cache
 chmod a+w cache

 profit.
